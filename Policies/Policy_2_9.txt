For every data contract, list all fields in the schema ahead of validation.
Each field shall contain:
- `name` (optional)
- `dataType` (optional)
- `description` (required and non-empty)
- `constraint` (optional)

Evaluation rules:
1. If the `description` key is present, treat it as properly formatted.
2. A `description` key is mandatory for every field; if missing, report an error.
3. Only the explicit literal `"description": ""` is considered empty.
4. Validate only those fields you extracted; do not infer or assume defaults.
5. A non-empty `description` is considered valid.

When requirements are fulfilled, set `satisfiesPolicy = true`; otherwise `satisfiesPolicy = false` and list missing items.
