For each data contract: list every field in the schema before validation.
Required per field:
- `name` (optional)
- `dataType` (optional)
- `description` (required, not empty)
- `constraint` (optional)

Enforce:
1. If `description` is present, accept its formatting.
2. Each field MUST have a `description` key; if absent, raise an error.
3. Only `"description": ""` counts as an empty description.
4. Validate strictly on the extracted fields; never infer defaults.
5. Non-empty `description` is deemed valid.

If complete, output `satisfiesPolicy = true`; otherwise `satisfiesPolicy = false` and list the missing fields.
