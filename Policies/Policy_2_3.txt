Extract and list all schema fields for each data contract prior to validation.
Per-field content must include:
- `name` (optional)
- `dataType` (optional)
- `description` (required; not empty)
- `constraint` (optional)

Evaluation logic:
1. Presence of `description` implies format is accepted.
2. Each field MUST contain the `description` key; absence ⇒ error.
3. Consider a description empty ONLY if `"description": ""` is explicitly present.
4. Validate solely the fields extracted; do not infer or assume defaults.
5. A present, non-empty `description` is considered well-formed.

All checks pass ⇒ `satisfiesPolicy = true`; otherwise `satisfiesPolicy = false` with missing elements listed.
