Perform field extraction before any validation for every data contract in the descriptor, listing all schema fields.
Each field MUST include:
- `name` (optional)
- `dataType` (optional)
- `description` (required and non-empty)
- `constraint` (optional)

Validation rules:
1. If a `description` key is present, treat it as correctly formatted.
2. Every field MUST contain a `description` key; if missing, report an error.
3. Consider `description` empty only when the JSON literally has "description": "".
4. Validate only the extracted fields—do not infer missing values or defaults.
5. If `description` exists and is non-empty, assume it is properly formatted.

All requirements met ⇒ `satisfiesPolicy = true`; otherwise set `satisfiesPolicy = false` and list the missing items.
