For each data contract, enumerate all fields in its schema before any validation.
Each field MUST include:
- `name` (optional)
- `dataType` (optional)
- `description` (mandatory, non-empty)
- `constraint` (optional)

Rules:
1. When a `description` key exists, treat it as correctly formatted.
2. Every field MUST have a `description` key; if missing, report an error.
3. An empty description is an error only when explicitly `"description": ""`.
4. Validate strictly on the extracted fields; do not infer defaults.
5. If `description` is present and non-empty, assume it is properly formatted.

When all requirements are met, set `satisfiesPolicy = true`; otherwise `satisfiesPolicy = false` and list the missing items.
