Before performing any validation, extract and list all schema fields for each data contract in the descriptor.
Each field MUST contain:
- `name` (optional)
- `dataType` (optional)
- `description` (required and must be non-empty)
- `constraint` (optional)

Validation rules:
1. If a `description` field is explicitly present, assume it is correctly formatted.
2. Every schema field must contain a description field. If the key is missing, report an error.
3. If a description is present but empty, return an error only if the JSON explicitly has `"description": ""`.
4. Validate only on the extracted schema fieldsâ€”DO NOT infer missing values or assume defaults.
5. If description is explicitly present and non-empty, assume it is correctly formatted.

If all required fields are present, return `satisfiesPolicy = true`. Otherwise, return `satisfiesPolicy = false` with missing fields listed.
